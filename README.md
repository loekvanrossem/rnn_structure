## Contents

- **source:** This folder contains source code and utilities used for conducting experiments.
- **parity:** The main RNN experiment from the paper, visualizing the automaton learned during training on the streaming parity task.
- **grokking:** Re-implementation of the modular arithmetic experiment from [Grokking](https://mathai-iclr.github.io/papers/papers/MATHAI_29_paper.pdf), taken from [this](https://github.com/Sea-Snell/grokking) repository.
